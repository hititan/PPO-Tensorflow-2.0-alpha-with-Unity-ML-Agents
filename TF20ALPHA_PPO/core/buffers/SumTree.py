'''
SumTree is binary tree data structure where the parents value is the sum of its children priorities. 
In the leaf nodes you can find priorities and the corresponding data-object (o,a,r)

Goal is searching fast for a priority which is sampled by a random uniform distribution
Priority is searched over SUM of priorities

So you dont have to go through a sorted Array from max priority to min priority 
Probability of being sampled is Pi = priority[i] / Sum od all priorities
